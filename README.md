# Substitute Bot

This is a python-telegram-bot project. This bot will allow you to create custom user groups (like `whateveryoulike`), assign users to them and use those groups in any conversation via inline mode. Those groups will be automatically expanded into usernames of all their members. That way you can notify whoever you like and they will surely hear you!

Open the bot and check it yourself! https://telegram.me/substitute_bot

If you have any comments/suggestions, please, open an issue.
